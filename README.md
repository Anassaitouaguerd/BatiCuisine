    - Register clients with details such as name, address, phone number.
    - Differentiate between professional and individual clients.
    - Apply discounts and taxes based on client type.

- **Quote Generation:**

    - Issue and validate dates for quotes.
    - Track whether a quote has been accepted by the client.

- **Cost Calculation:**
    - Integrate all component costs into total project cost.
    - Apply beneficiary margin to get the final project cost.
    - Account for applicable VAT and discounts.
